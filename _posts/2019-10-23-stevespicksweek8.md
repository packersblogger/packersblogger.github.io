## **WAS (9) at MIN (19)** 
### **Redskins +16** *(Thursday Night)* 
I like the Vikings to cover. 
>I hate the Vikings pretty much more than anything else in life, but at home they play well.

So assuming the Skins have their boy Keenum back in town under one of the worst offensive lines in football, I don’t see Washington scoring much. Think this one is about 31-10 Vikings. 

## **SEA (27) at ATL (20)** 

## **PHI (31) at BUF (13)** 
### **Philly +2** 
hmmm, this is actually a tough one. Buffalo plays really well at home, but I just have this weird feeling that Philly is going to start clicking soon. On the road at Buffalo though is not where it will happen for the Eagles. I’ll take Buffalo to cover the 2 points. I think this one will be close as the line suggests, and Philly feels extra shitty after this one.

## **LAC (17) at CHI (16)** 
### **LAC +4** 
Coach Nagy is so cool. Did you happen to see his response to how shitty his offense is? Nagy went on some tangent about how he’s not going to let the media tear his team apart. Good for you, back against the wall, everyone is against you, let’s rise to the challenge! Why don’t you try running the ball on that fucked up field of yours more than 10 times a game – maybe at least you won’t lose by 3 scores at home then. My hatred for the Bears aside, I do see them bouncing back somewhat this week and covering the 4 points.
## **NYG (26) at DET (31)** 
### **NY Giants +7** 
Lions cover. The Lions aren’t a bad team, and they are still so frustrated with the Packers game acting like it was the most controversial game in the history of the NFL 

>never mind the Packers were the reason the goddamn replacement refs got fired in the “failmary” game, so just shut the hell up Detroit, and put up another couple billboards to make yourselves feel better. 

But yea, they use that pent-up frustration to really right the ship this week and put them back on track for their 8-8 year.
## **OAK (24) at HOU (27)** 
### **Oak +6.5**  
I’ll take Houston who needs a win.

## **NYJ (15) at JAX (29)** 
### **NY Jets +6**  
Can we just start to implement games not being played and just auto sim in Madden or something. Seriously, what a waste of time this game is. I’ll take the Jets with the points. Darnold might be seeing Jalen Ramsey’s ghost out there, but the rest of Jasonville’s roster is bad enough where that won’t matter.

## **CIN (10) at LA (24)** 
### **Cinci +13** 
Rams. All fucking day Rams. Cinci is so bad I don’t know what else to say.

## **ARI (9) at NO (31)** 

## **TB (23) at TEN (27)** 
### **TB +2.5**  
who is actually going to watch this game,but sure, I’ll take the Bucs with the points on the road.

## **CAR (13) at SF (51)** 
### **Carolina +5.5**  
>oooooo, two teams that know deep down that they aren’t that good,
but just keep looking at their record and thinking “maybe we are actually half way decent”. 

Well both teams are not that good and are going to get lit the fuck up in the playoffs (assuming Carolina makes it, which actually they won’t so don’t even worry about them). But I’ll take San Fran I guess. East coast team going West, albeit in that corporate as fuck stadium of San Fran which isn’t even in San Fran I don’t think, and a rookie QB going up a good SF defense, I think San Fran wins by a touchdown. 

## **DEN (13) at IND (15)** 
I don’t even care what the line is for Denver going forward. I will bet against Joe Flacco all the days of my life until the last one. And that’s not to say that Denver won’t here or there cover a spread or win with the points, but it’s because 

>I won’t live my life knowing I lost even a dollar betting on Joe Flacco. 

Seriously, put that guy on the Madden cover so he’s the poor bastard who’s getting hurt every year. Indy by at least a touchdown in this one.

## **CLE (13) at NE (27)** 
### **Cleveland +13**  
I think Cleveland plays halfway decent and forces this to be a low scoring game. New England will win 17-13 or something like that. Also very possible they embarrass Cleveland and put Baker in an even worse tailspin towards being a full time world class d bag by winning like 38-3 or something. But yea I’ll take Cleveland with the points.

## **GB (31) at KC (24)** 
### **Green Bay -4** *(Sunday Night)*  
I don’t disclose my Packer picks. *So from RCW:* **Its the Packers.** This will look like the Dallas game, with the Packers playing with the lead for the majority of the game. The blueprint is out there for how to defeat KC they were annointed ones going into the season but even before the Mahomes injury they showed vulnerabilities week to week.  The Packers are rolling at the moment so I see them overcoming the hostile environment silencing the home crowd to the tune of 31-20. It will be a statement win.

## **MIA (0) at PIT (0)** 
### **Miami +14.5** *(Monday Night – wow, what a tight game!)*
>Miami is really bad. 

14.5 is a lot for a team like Pittsburgh to cover, but Miami really is that bad. Only thing is this is on Monday night, so the refs will find a way to keep this close – I’ll take Miami with the points
