## **Los Angeles Chargers** (-1.5,-125) | -105 | o(48.5,-115) at
## **Oakland Raiders** (1.5,+105) | -115 | u(48.5,-105)
11-07-2019 18:20:00 MST


**SJW:** Chargers

Both teams are quietly pretty good. The Chargers just have more talent and it’s finally playing half way decent as evidenced by them embarrassing the Packers last week. Phillip is still fully capable of doing the same stupid shit he always does about 8 games a year (see game vs Pittsburgh this year), but I really have grown to not like Derek Carr. Despite Jon Gruden creating a system where even Carr can look like a capable QB, I think the San Diego defense continues it’s play from last week and makes Derek cry again – which as you remember happened when he snapped his leg in half a few years back. His teammates loved seeing his tears and even went as far to make fun of him in the media. Also, now that I think of it, Derek was my least favorite person on Hard Knocks this year too – so yea I’m confident in my San Diego pick Thursday Night. 


## **Detroit Lions** (3.0,+115) | -125 | o(41.5,-110) at
## **Chicago Bears** (-3.0,-135) | +105 | u(41.5,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW:** Lions

This will be close or wait no it won't the Bears have proven their futility and they suck.  The Lions will win by 2td.

**SJW:**Lions +3

The Lions aren’t bad. The Bears really can’t score for shit. This will be one of the uglier games of the year, for 2 very very ugly franchises – but I like the Lions with the points because this one legit could end 0-0.

## **New York Giants** (-2.5,-140) | -110 | o(43.5,-110) at
## **New York Jets** (2.5,+120) | -110 | u(43.5,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW:** Giants

Two terrible teams but someone has to win.  I like the Giants.  They had some actual ideas against Dallas.  

**SJW:**Giants -2.5

Yea this is your weekly “holy Christ this game is awful” game of the week. I guess I’ll take the Giants since they are trying their hardest to prove that Daniel Jones was a good pick.

## **Atlanta Falcons** (13.0,+435) | -105 | o(51.5,-105) at
## **New Orleans Saints** (-13.0,-670) | -115 | u(51.5,-115)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW:** Saints

Atlanta is awful and cannot see them being competitive in this one.  They will lose big.

**SJW:**NO -13

New Orleans is good and ATL is about to be the worst team in the league the next 3 years. Like everything in ATL needs to be restarted. GM Demitrov and Coach Quinn will be gone after this year, Matt Ryan will be that mid 30’s QB that was never even that good but will be next year’s Eli Manning where the rookie who has no business playing will start over him, and that nice new contract they gave to Julio will just reinforce why Demitrov doesn’t want to leave his office because he’s thinking back to being up 28-3 in the Super Bowl and wondering how things went so horribly wrong so fast. ATL is really screwed.

## **Baltimore Ravens** (-10.0,-500) | -115 | o(45.5,-110) at
## **Cincinnati Bengals ** (10.0,+350) | -105 | u(45.5,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW:**Ravens

After the statement win against NE I think they are legitimately in the top group of NFL teams. 

**SJW:**Baltimore -10
I don’t have too much to say about this one other than Baltimore shouldn’t have any problem taking care of an awful Cincinnati team. 10 points is a good amount, but Baltimore should run all over the Bengals and now with the Bengals starting a quarterback I’ve never heard of,they shouldn’t score more than 3 points. 

## **Buffalo Bills** (2.5,+125) | -105 | o(40.0,-110) at
## **Cleveland Browns** (-2.5,-145) | -115 | u(40.0,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW:** Bills

A guy I work with really likes Josh Allen because he lives in Wyoming and there is nothing else to do but buy campers, boats, guns and watch the Cowboys.  Apparently Allen makes a point to return on a regular basis to Laramie. I will take the Bills.

**SJW:**Cleveland -2.5

I really don’t like Freddie Kitchens. I’m still amazed this guy was offered a head coaching job, but I do think they win this game and cover the points – have this feeling like Buffalo won’t

## **Arizona Cardinals** (4.5,+185) | -110 | o(51.0,-110) at
## **Tampa Bay Buccaneers** (-4.5,-225) | -110 | u(51.0,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW:** Tampa

I'll take Tampa which is a really trashy city btw.  Clearwater beach is nice if you only stare out into the Ocean and the setting sun, as soon as you turn around you realize how big a shit hole that town is.  Something about Florida I really do not like.  If you like Florida that's fine GFY.

**SJW:**AZ +4.5

I really don’t know much about these teams, but I watched the AZ/San Fran game last week and was pretty impressed with Kyler. Jesus that would suck to be that short, but he can make all the throws and think he plays well in this one.

## **Miami Dolphins** (10.5,+375) | -115 | o(44.0,-110) at
## **Indianapolis Colts** (-10.5,-550) | -105 | u(44.0,-110)
11-10-2019 14:05:00 MST

**RCW:** Colts

I will always take the Colts in this situation.  My roommate in college was a HUGE Colts and Hoosiers fan.  I am sure he still is.  You're welcome Chris.  The computer model may say otherwise.

**SJW:**Colts -10.5

I could be wrong here, and I’m much too hungover to check, but I swear Brian Hoyer is starting for the Colts. This has that game where the old/close to retired QB plays well and is all jacked up thinking “fuck yea I can still do this” only to throw 4 INTs next week and the team begging for the starter to come back early from injury written all over it. So for this game, I think Brian gets it done and dismantles an absolutely horrendous Miami team.



## **Carolina Panthers** (5.0,+190) | -105 | o(47.0,-110) at
## **Green Bay Packers** (-5.0,-230) | -115 | u(47.0,-110)
11-10-2019 14:25:00 MST

**RCW:** Packers

Coming off an embarssment in Cali. I think La Fleur and his group needed it honestly.  Big win in KC on national tv it was always going to be tough to get up for the Chargers.  No one gets up for the Chargers ever anyway.  So back in Lambeau I see the offense getting back on track with Adams in fold and the D creating pressure for whoever Carolina's QB is.  I take the Pack. 

**SJW:** Doesn't pick packers games. Not totally sure why but its probably because he would be more often incorrect.  As I suspect he was last week.  

## **Los Angeles Rams** (-4.0,-200) | -110 | o(44.0,-115) at
## **Pittsburgh Steelers** (4.0,+170) | -110 | u(44.0,-105)
11-10-2019 14:25:00 MST

**RCW:** Steelers

Just feel like Pitt is due to put some things together.

**SJW:**Rams – 4

I really don’t get how Pitt is still being competitive. I guess they do still have some players on defense, and JuJu is a nice WR… but not the slightest idea who is playing QB (Is it still that guy who got knocked the fuck out on national TV where they took his facemask off then let him walk off on his own with everyone watching and wondering what in the hell is going on and why is this guy not on a stretcher – Mason something, maybe Rudolph?). Regardless, I think the Rams get it done on the road and cover the 4 points.

## **Minnesota Vikings** (3.0,+135) | -115 | o(48.0,-110) at
## **Dallas Cowboys** (-3.0,-155) | -105 | u(48.0,-110)
11-10-2019 18:20:00 MST

**RCW:** Vikings

I think this one pushes Garrett to the brink of unemployment.  I hate minny but I really hate the vibe the Cowboys give off.  They have a sense of entitlement and that comes from that cock sucker in the owners box.  My reasoning for hating jerry so much stems from those mid 90's games when I first started watching football really and understanding what was going on.  Barry Switzer getting busted with a gun at the airport.  Fuck the Cowboys and I hope they miss the playoffs.  Jerry is not long for this world and its not nice but there's not a lot of sympathy I have for the guy his team is mediocre and there's a reason they are one of about 6 teams to not have seen at least a Conference Championship game since 96.

**SJW:** Vikings +3

I hate to say this, and if there’s one game I’m actually confident in here (sorry for mentioning that this is the only game I’d actually put money on at the end of this post), but the Vikings are good. The Cowboys on the other hand, as I’ve said the last few weeks, are softer than Kirk Cousins 1.5 inch flaccid penis (he asked me to put the .5 in there btw) and won’t manage much against the Vikings defense. I personally do hope that somebody puts their helmet straight through the vertebrae of Cousins, even if I do put my money on the Vikings, but yea – the Vikings should be solid with the +3.

## **Seattle Seahawks** (6.0,+220) | -110 | o(46.5,-110) at
## **San Francisco 49ers** (-6.0,-270) | -110 | u(46.5,-110)
11-11-2019 18:15:00 MST

**RCW:**Seattle 

Niners are gonna shit the bed here soon.  I think it's Monday night on the national stage.

**SJW:**Seattle +6

I’m still waiting for the Niners to come back down to earth. I’ve heard Kittle is out (because he’s on one of my nine fantasy teams) and that’s a huge blow to Jimmy’s ability to convert 3rd downs. So I’ll take Seattle with the 6 points.
