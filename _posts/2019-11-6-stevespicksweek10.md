## **Los Angeles Chargers** (-1.5,-125) | -105 | o(48.5,-115) at
## **Oakland Raiders** (1.5,+105) | -115 | u(48.5,-105)

**My Pick: San Diego**

**SJW:**Both teams are quietly pretty good. The Chargers just have more talent and it’s finally playing half way decent as evidenced by them embarrassing the Packers last week. Phillip is still fully capable of doing the same stupid shit he always does about 8 games a year (see game vs Pittsburgh this year), but I really have grown to not like Derek Carr. Despite Jon Gruden creating a system where even Carr can look like a capable QB, I think the San Diego defense continues it’s play from last week and makes Derek cry again – which as you remember happened when he snapped his leg in half a few years back. His teammates loved seeing his tears and even went as far to make fun of him in the media. Also, now that I think of it, Derek was my least favorite person on Hard Knocks this year too – so yea I’m confident in my San Diego pick Thursday Night. 


## **Detroit Lions** (3.0,+115) | -125 | o(41.5,-110) at
## **Chicago Bears** (-3.0,-135) | +105 | u(41.5,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW** This will be close or wait no it won't the Bears have proven their futility and they suck.  The Lions will win by 2td.

## **New York Giants** (-2.5,-140) | -110 | o(43.5,-110) at
## **New York Jets** (2.5,+120) | -110 | u(43.5,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW**Two terrible teams but someone has to win.  I like the Giants.  They had some actual ideas against Dallas.  

## **Atlanta Falcons** (13.0,+435) | -105 | o(51.5,-105) at
## **New Orleans Saints** (-13.0,-670) | -115 | u(51.5,-115)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW**Atlanta is awful and cannot see them being competitive in this one.  They will lose big.

## **Baltimore Ravens** (-10.0,-500) | -115 | o(45.5,-110) at
## **Cincinnati Bengals ** (10.0,+350) | -105 | u(45.5,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW**Ravens.  After the statement win against NE I think they are legitimately in the top group of NFL teams. 
## **Buffalo Bills** (2.5,+125) | -105 | o(40.0,-110) at
## **Cleveland Browns** (-2.5,-145) | -115 | u(40.0,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW**I am a Bills fan and a guy I work with really likes Josh Allen because he lives in Wyoming and there is nothing else to do but buy campers, boats, guns and watch the Cowboys.  Apparently Allen makes a point to return on a regular basis to Laramie.
## **Arizona Cardinals** (4.5,+185) | -110 | o(51.0,-110) at
## **Tampa Bay Buccaneers** (-4.5,-225) | -110 | u(51.0,-110)
11-10-2019 11:00:00 MST

**RCW:**Couldn't care less.  I'll take Tampa which is a really trashy city btw.  Clearwater beach is nice if you only stare out into the Ocean and the setting sun, as soon as you turn around you realize how big a shit hole that town is.  Something about Florida I really do not like.  If you like Florida that's fine GFY.

## **Miami Dolphins** (10.5,+375) | -115 | o(44.0,-110) at
## **Indianapolis Colts** (-10.5,-550) | -105 | u(44.0,-110)
11-10-2019 14:05:00 MST

**RCW**I will always take the Colts in this situation.  My roommate in college was a HUGE Colts and Hoosiers fan.  I am sure he still is.  You're welcome Chris.  The computer model may say otherwise.

## **Carolina Panthers** (5.0,+190) | -105 | o(47.0,-110) at
## **Green Bay Packers** (-5.0,-230) | -115 | u(47.0,-110)
11-10-2019 14:25:00 MST

**RCW**Packers at home.  Coming off an embarssment in Cali. I think La Fleur and his group needed it honestly.  Big win in KC on national tv it was always going to be tough to get up for the Chargers.  No one gets up for the Chargers ever anyway.  So back in Lambeau I see the offense getting back on track with Adams in fold and the D creating pressure for whoever Carolina's QB is.  I take the Pack.  

## **Los Angeles Rams** (-4.0,-200) | -110 | o(44.0,-115) at
## **Pittsburgh Steelers** (4.0,+170) | -110 | u(44.0,-105)
11-10-2019 14:25:00 MST

**RCW**I will take the steelers.  Just feel like Pitt is due to put some things together.

## **Minnesota Vikings** (3.0,+135) | -115 | o(48.0,-110) at
## **Dallas Cowboys** (-3.0,-155) | -105 | u(48.0,-110)
11-10-2019 18:20:00 MST

**RCW**Minnesota I think this one pushes Garrett to the brink of unemployment.  I hate minny but I really hate the vibe the Cowboys give off.  They have a sense of entitlement and that comes from that cock sucker in the owners box.  My reasoning for hating jerry so much stems from those mid 90's games when I first started watching football really and understanding what was going on.  Barry Switzer getting busted with a gun at the airport.  Fuck the Cowboys and I hope they miss the playoffs.  Jerry is not long for this world and its not nice but there's not a lot of sympathy I have for the guy his team is mediocre and there's a reason they are one of about 6 teams to not have seen at least a Conference Championship game since 96.

## **Seattle Seahawks** (6.0,+220) | -110 | o(46.5,-110) at
## **San Francisco 49ers** (-6.0,-270) | -110 | u(46.5,-110)
11-11-2019 18:15:00 MST

**RCW**Seattle.  Niners are gonna shit the bed here soon.  I think it's Monday night on the national stage.
