## Rodgers Packers Grow from Self Doubt  

Packers getting ready to face the Titans tonight on Thursday Night Football presented by Amazon.  No excuse not to watch because Amazon just laid you off.  Growth is hard to come by at the moment boys and girls.  No matter, we have to keep trying.  Interestingly in Rodgers post game or early week presser he addressed a somewhat touchy if not difficult to articulate topic of self doubt and the "little voice on your shoulder" as he called it.  The voice it seems had been having its way with him, his decision making, execution and overall performance.

Rodgers talking about this voice of doubt was telling.  Of course after his performance against the Cowboys it was a relief I am sure to him more than anyone to be able to as he said "send that voice back to hell".  While he was getting into this conversation about this voice on his shoulder it seemed or at least I imagined all the journalists in the room thinking about their own little voice on their shoulder telling them they don't know how to write or ask a good question in front of a bunch of people.  To be able to cast that voice off and back to hell is truly something that needs to be done from time to time.  A true burden, self doubt can handcuff even the most powerful and talented of individuals.  Not to excuse the play of the Packers leading up to their performance against the Cowboys but teams players and people in general must at times hit a rough patch in order to reset.  Cast the voice back to hell. 

So like the rest of us Rodgers and Company keep trying.  Growth often happens in the most dire of situations and indeed for the Packers, while not dire outside of the fact the Vikings have a much better record, it seems they may be on the upswing once again.  Just when it looked like they would actually fold mail it in tear it down blow it up - a rookie stepped up, a veteran cast aside the voice of self doubt on his shoulder.  Can they do it again tonight?
