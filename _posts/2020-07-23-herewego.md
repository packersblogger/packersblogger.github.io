## This is Exciting  

This is exciting.  Baseball is set to resume this Friday for the Brewers with a marquee matchup in the Windy City.  Something is brewing.  Corbin Burnes has been unhittable and the Brewers pitching staff looks poised to be effective for a full less than half of a season.  Still Burnes is just as likely to contract COVID19 and end up hospitalized as he is win the Cy Young so we are in a peculiar situation when evaluating effectiveness.

## I can't wait

I can't wait to see Braun roll over a change up and walk straight to the dug out.  What's the use in running hard to first?  It isn't worth it.  Think of the risk.  Teachers don't want to go back to the classroom this fall it is impressive any of these guys are ok stepping up to the plate.  Oh but they are getting paid a little more I guess. 

## Craig in a mask?

Will Craig be wearing a mask when he trots out to the mound?  Everyone knows he never leaves Whitefish Bay so I am not sure why he would.  Oh but the mask isn't just for other people its for you as well.  Fear runs both ways up and down the mountain.  Fear cares not if you are a simple minded hobit or power hungry wizard.  My money is on Craig wearing a mask the whole time because he is responsible and I trust Craig.  I did not trust him the first time he ran/walked out to the mound but he is quickly becoming, at least for me, the face of the organization.

## Prediction

I am picking the Brewers.  I actually do like their team this year and the retooling that Stearns has done is impressive.  Ultimately the Brewers success will hinge on the pitching staff effectiveness.  Unfortunately effectiveness might just be the ability to take the ball every 5 days and not ending up on a respirator.  Sure this season may just amount to a very weakly hit grounder but I am still very glad its back.
