## Packers Return to an Old Roman Fort  

The Packers are travelling to play in an old Roman fort this weekend.  Now it's reffered to as Tottenham Hostspur Stadium.  Spurs are an English Premiere League team that play Saturday Morning @11:30 in Brighton about 3 hours south of London.  It is worth tuning into some of these Premiere league games as they often prove a lot more entertaining than some of the NFL games.  Especially after the most recent Thursday night game with the poor poor Broncos.  Anything is better than wasting your time with that.  For instance spending your time contemplating why with regards to anything is more productive than watching that game last night.  Maybe you disagree.  No matter.  Check out the premiere league tomorrow morning on NBC Sports it would be a nice lead up to the Packer game on Sunday morning.  The Tottenham Brighton matchup is a good early season fixture too as Brighton sit in 3rd and Tottenham 4th.  

## Giants are for real?
I do not know anything about the Giants.  My gut tells me that the Packers will actually have to play much better in order to win.  Then again with both teams travelling this one is anyone's guess as to how either team might perform.  I think the Packers will be fortunate to win given their current form.  It is hard enough to win in the NFL let alone in an old Roman Fort.
