## Trying to see yourself is risky business

This part of the NFL season seems to flat line in terms of intrigue.  Much like whatever show you are streaming tends to for episodes 4-7 + or - an episode. The plot and characters in it seem to stop, turn around and look at themselves to see if they’re still there.  Trying to see oneself as others see them is impossible, similar to what being in a black hole might be like, so attempting it is incredibly risky especially for writers paid by wildly overvalued streaming companies.

We are at this point in the NFL season.  For teams that have a healthy lead in their respective division playoff preparations start and maintenance mode sets in.  Teams expect to beat lesser opponents when they need to and if they don’t then it doesn’t matter anyway starters sit etc. 

As one of the 32 characters in the NFL, the Packers have stunted in their development, resting on the fact that they have had 8 - 9 decent episodes.  Still three episodes involved some terrible writing and even worse acting. Similar to the mid season episodes of the HBO series The Righteous Gemstones.  I find Danny McBride to be funny enough that even if he lobs up some real garbage and painfully dark humor I trust quality will eventually manifest itself.  Whether or not quality did eventually show its face in Gemstones is debatable – does a full grown man becoming a baby in a vat of drugs in the basement of a satanic rave party count? No idea.  Regardless 2 of the Packers losses should have been turned off in the 1st quarter and did not warrant anyone spending any time watching them much like episodes 4 and 5 or thereabouts of Gemstones.

So like Gemstones, despite having several flop episodes there is still reason to believe that the writers responsible for the Packers character can maintain its integrity and ultimately produce something of quality.  Unfortunately there are a few more throw away episodes left 'to play with' until we get closer to the episode 16 matchup with the Vikings a precursor to the series finale on Feb 2, but the return of intrigue.  This is assuming the Packers do not spend too much time trying to figure out if they exist and what metaphysics is.
