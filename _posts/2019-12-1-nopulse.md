## Trying to see yourself is risky business  

This part of the NFL season seems to flat line.  Much like whatever show you are streaming does for episodes 4-7 + or - an episode. The plot and characters in it seem to stop, turn around and look at themselves to see if they’re still there.  Indeed, trying to see oneself as they might actually exist is impossible - scary even, similar to what being in a black hole might be like, so attempting it is incredibly risky.  Some shows never really get back on track and are lost in a meandering scheme to keep the viewer hooked all the while searching for the path that will lead them out of the labyrinth they willingly wandered into in an effort to extend contracts and baffle viewers into trying to figure out how someone could do that.  Take Matthew Mconaughy in Interstellar as an example. He became a bunch of books on a bookshelf. Terrifying.  The Packers like many teams headed for the playoffs are currently taking time trying to get a look at who they really are.  I know who they are but they have to know an entirely different being - a limitless one.

> * met·a·phys·ics
/ˌmedəˈfiziks/
noun
the branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space.  

For teams that have a healthy lead in their respective division playoff preparations have started.  Teams expect to beat lesser opponents when they need to and if they don’t then it doesn’t matter anyway starters sit etc.  Teams have their identity at this point.  Furthermore teams have cause to believe that their identity is something other than the one fans and media have imposed.  This internal belief transcends identity itself and is limitless.  Does it exist is the question.

As one of the 32 characters in the NFL, the Packers have stalled in their development, resting on the fact that they have had 8 - 9 decent episodes. They have their identity, which to me is the 4th best team in the NFC. Three episodes involved some terrible writing and even worse acting. Similar to the mid season episodes of the HBO series The Righteous Gemstones.  

I find Danny McBride to be funny enough that even if he lobs up some real garbage and painfully dark humor I trust quality will eventually manifest itself.  Whether or not quality did eventually show its face in Gemstones is debatable – does a full grown man becoming a baby in a vat of drugs in the basement of a satanic rave party count? No idea.  But 2 of the Packers losses should have been turned off in the 1st quarter and did not warrant anyone spending any time watching them much like episodes 4 and 5 or thereabouts of Gemstones. 

Ultimately for the Packers, despite having several flop episodes, there is still reason to believe that the writers responsible can ultimately produce something of quality.  Unfortunately there are a few more throw away episodes left 'to play with' until we get closer to the episode 16 matchup with the Vikings.  This is assuming the Packers do not spend too much time trying to figure out if they actually exist.  In truth they could just as easily end up as a pile of books on a bookshelf trying to communicate with the rest of us. The Packers cannot fold time onto itself only time can do that.  They would be better served catching the ball when it is thrown their way and demolishing opponents with conviction.
